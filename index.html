        <br>
            <p>Today isn’t just another day — it’s a celebration of you, my wonderful darling.
                Eighteen years of light, laughter, growth, and quiet strength and somehow, in this vast universe, I get to witness a piece of your journey.
                This space is for you — a digital keepsake, a letter across screens,
                a gift from my heart to yours.
                Take your time, breathe it in, and know that you are deeply loved — exactly as you are.

        <h3>18 KA NA DARLINGG!!</h3>
        <br>
            <p> Happy 18th birthday! You made it, darling ko. Officially adult ka naa — though I’ll be honest, you've always carried the kind of wisdom and strength that goes beyond age. Still, today calls for a celebration, may it be simple or grand. It’s not just your birthday; it’s a milestone.
I know that you’ve been through a lot. And somehow, you still show up with that bubbly smile of yours darling, that sparkle of joy in your eye, and that laugh that makes everything feel a little lighter. That’s something I admire so much about you Cathryn.
I know that this is cheesy (baket baa, blehh), but I am lucky. Lucky that I got to know you. Lucky that I get to laugh with you. Lucky that I get to cheer you on as you step into this next chapter of your life.
I hope 18 brings you good chaos — the kind that comes from chasing dreams, discovering new sides of yourself, getting lost in moments that matter, and realizing just how powerful you are.
So go out there, live a little louder, laugh a little harder, and love yourself a whole lot more. You’ve got this — and I’ve got you.
<br><br>Always rooting for you,
<br><br>
Ryle
